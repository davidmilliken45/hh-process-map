## üéØ Implementation Highlights

### Health Status Logic
Components are automatically assigned health status based on metrics:
- **GREEN:** ‚â•90% of metrics meet targets
- **YELLOW:** 70-89% of metrics meet targets
- **RED:** <70% of metrics meet targets

Dashboard health score uses weighted values:
- GREEN = 100 points
- BLUE = 70 points
- YELLOW = 60 points
- GRAY = 50 points
- RED = 20 points

### Architecture Patterns
- **Server Components** - Default for pages, optimal performance
- **Client Components** - Only for interactive UI elements
- **API Routes** - RESTful with proper HTTP methods
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript throughout
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive with proper status codes

### Performance Optimizations
- Server-side data fetching
- Prisma query optimization with includes
- Component memoization where appropriate
- Efficient re-renders with proper key usage
- Lazy loading for detail panels
